Below you'll find one of the Data Analytics projects I've done for Yandex Afisha (large online tickets booking service).

It contains detailed analysis of visits, orders and marketing sources (including cohorts retention, LTV and ROMI).

It's a study project with detailed comments, for the summary please feel free to use Table of Contents and jump right to the graphs and conclusions at the bottom.
